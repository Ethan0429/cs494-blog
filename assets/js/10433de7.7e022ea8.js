Because of this layout, it was difficult to understand at first considering other common 8x8 LED matrix parts follow a more standard layout. The MAX7219 LED matrix model, for example, is composed of 4 pins on both sides.

Because of this, we use a short delay between screen refreshes. However, this also meant that the ball would move too fast for the player to react to. We had to implement a tick system to prevent this. The ball would only move once the tick reached a certain value. This value was chosen arbitrarily, but it worked the best based on our testing."),(0,i.kt)("h2",{id:"conclusion"},"Conclusion"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Overall, this project was extremely fun.
